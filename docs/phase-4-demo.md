# Phase 4 — Interactive Demo

**Duration**: 1–2 weeks  
**Goal**: Public demo + README polish.  
**Tools**: Gradio/Streamlit, asciinema

---

## Deliverables
- Web demo (Streamlit/Gradio)
- Demo GIF (`docs/demo.gif`)
- Final README (with architecture diagram + demo links)

---

## Why It Matters
Makes the project tangible and shareable. Captures real-world phrasing, feeds retraining. Provides low-friction portfolio artifact.

## Risks & Premortem
| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation |
|------|----------------|------------|
| Demo instability (real tiger) | Credibility loss | Log failures for retraining |
| Deployment friction (paper tiger) | Slows portfolio timeline | Use HuggingFace Spaces or Streamlit Cloud |
| Poor UX (real tiger) | Users won’t see value | Simple NL → slots → SPL flow |
| Over-promising features (real tiger) | Confuses scope | Roadmap separation in README |
