## Risks & Premortem
| Risk | Why It Matters | Mitigation |
|------|----------------|------------|
| License confusion (paper tiger) | Blocks adoption | Apache 2.0 pre-selected |
| Repo inconsistency (real tiger) | Deters contributors | CONTRIBUTING.md + CI |
| Unclear contribution workflow (paper → real later) | Slows engagement | Add templates in this phase |
| CI failures on public repo (real tiger) | Bad optics | Keep CI minimal + stable |
| Low visibility (paper tiger) | Weak career impact | Demo links, LinkedIn post |
| Security disclosures (real tiger) | Mishandled reports | GitHub’s security policy template |
